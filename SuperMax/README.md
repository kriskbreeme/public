# Supermax.py


### Brief Description
SuperMax is a small python script that runs in the command line. The script currently only does something useful if my favorite F1 driver wins the race. If so, it displays some information regarding the race. If he lost,
it displays a commonly used phrase amongst the F1 community. There is also a bonus easter egg once the script runs. This was my small project to understand how to call and extract data from an API's JSON response using python.


### How to Run (on a Windows machine)
- download supermax.py file
- open command prompt
- navigate to directory where file was downloaded (ex: cd desktop, or cd downloads etc.)
- type in python supermax.py and hit enter
- watch the magic happen (but only if he won this week)

### Plans for more function
- add a more robust else function that displays the actual winning driver of the race as well as stats about him
- turn this into some sort of simple webapp where if you load the webpage then these stats display on the screen instead of just printing to the command line
